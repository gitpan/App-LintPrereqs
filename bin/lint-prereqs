=head1 NAME

lint-prereqs - Check extraneous/missing prerequisites in dist.ini

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 0.16 of lint-prereqs (from Perl distribution App-LintPrereqs), released on 2014-08-16.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Usage:

 % lint-prereqs

Examples:

 TODO

To see all options:

 % lint-prereqs --help

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Check [Prereqs / *] sections in your dist.ini against what's actually being used
in your Perl code (using Perl::PrereqScanner) and what's in Perl core list of
modules. Will complain if your prerequisites are not actually used, or already
in Perl core. Will also complain if there are missing prerequisites.

Designed to work with prerequisites that are manually written. Does not work if
you use AutoPrereqs.

Sometimes there are prerequisites that you know are used but can't be detected
by scan_prereqs, or you want to include anyway. If this is the case, you can
instruct lint_prereqs to assume the prerequisite is used.

 ;!lint-prereqs assume-used # even though we know it is not currently used
 Foo::Bar=0
 ;!lint-prereqs assume-used # we are forcing a certain version
 Baz=0.12

Sometimes there are also prerequisites that are detected by scan_prereqs, but
you know are already provided by some other modules. So to make lint-prereqs
ignore them:

 [Extras / lint-prereqs / assume-provided]
 Qux::Quux=0
