NAME
    App::LintPrereqs - Check extraneous/missing prerequisites in dist.ini

VERSION
    version 0.14

SYNOPSIS
     # Use via lint-prereqs CLI script

FUNCTIONS
  lint_prereqs(%args) -> [status, msg, result, meta]
    Check extraneous/missing prerequisites in dist.ini.

    Check [Prereqs / *] sections in your dist.ini against what's actually
    being used in your Perl code (using Perl::PrereqScanner) and what's in
    Perl core list of modules. Will complain if your prerequisites are not
    actually used, or already in Perl core. Will also complain if there are
    missing prerequisites.

    Designed to work with prerequisites that are manually written. Does not
    work if you use AutoPrereqs.

    Sometimes there are prerequisites that you know are used but can't be
    detected by scan*prereqs, or you want to include anyway. If this is the
    case, you can instruct lint*prereqs to assume the prerequisite is used.

        ;!lint-prereqs assume-used # even though we know it is not currently used
        Foo::Bar=0
        ;!lint-prereqs assume-used # we are forcing a certain version
        Baz=0.12

    Sometimes there are also prerequisites that are detected by
    scan_prereqs, but you know are already provided by some other modules.
    So to make lint-prereqs ignore them:

        [Extras / lint-prereqs / assume-provided]
        Qux::Quux=0

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   perl_version => *str*

    Return value:

    Returns an enveloped result (an array). First element (status) is an
    integer containing HTTP status code (200 means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx
    function error). Second element (msg) is a string containing error
    message, or 'OK' if status is 200. Third element (result) is optional,
    the actual result. Fourth element (meta) is called result metadata and
    is optional, a hash that contains extra information.
